      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to revive my blog. One of the many things I learned at my awesome journey @DBC in 2015 is that we learn things everyday, and mostly we don&amp;rsquo;t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason why I restarted my blog: to write down about the things I learn, and think over about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting fresh, and that means that, by now, my old posts are all off. But that won&amp;rsquo;t be for long. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely put my old learnings and meditations about many cultural aspects that surround the technology world up again, as soon as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of my journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I intend to weekly explore the many interesting challenges I&amp;rsquo;m facing regarding product and engineering management at an impressive fast growing startup where I happen to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome and I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
