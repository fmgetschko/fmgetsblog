                    <p>It&rsquo;s been a while that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to revive my blog. One of the many things I learned at my awesome journey @DBC in 2015 is that we learn things everyday, and mostly we don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the main reason why I restarted my blog: to write down about the things I learn, and think over about them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting fresh, and that means that, by now, my old posts are all off. But that won&rsquo;t be for long. I&rsquo;ll definitely put my old learnings and meditations about many cultural aspects that surround the technology world up again, as soon as possible. It&rsquo;s an essential part of my journey!</p>

<p>For now, I intend to weekly explore the many interesting challenges I&rsquo;m facing regarding product and engineering management at an impressive fast growing startup where I happen to be.</p>

<p>Welcome and I hope you enjoy!</p>
